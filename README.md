**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**

I interpret user needs by their priority, meaning how necessary it will be not only to the program, but the users as well. For example; if I was working on a medical program that allowed users to view and update their medical information and one user mentioned I need to add "password recovery," while another use asked me to add "name preference" to the profile, I would prioritize password recovery before name preference. Both can be useful to the user, but one benefits the program and more users.

User stories helps with this process because the user stories give you many of the details in a quick, ledgible format. They're also manually put in descending order from most to least important by the Product Owner, so it is easy to find which tasks should be completed first.

**How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

I approach program development with a clear plan in mind. I have never been the type to just "jump in" to a project, instead I like to know exactly what needs to get done and often make lists to check off of as I complete tasks. 

One of the major agile processes I hope to incorporate in my future development work is review. Sometimes, once a task is complete, it can be difficult to then spend time reflecting on the task, especially when I have many more that I need to complete. That reflection time, however, can give you some crucial information and future lessons to follow especially when I come across problems I've faced in the past.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

I believe being a good team member in software development means regularly discussing with your team about your process, current completion level, and struggles you've faced up until now. I also believe it means being willing to help other team members when necessary, and providing encouragement and communicating in a helpful, positive way.
